Yesterday's session : Junit Introduction

Today's session : Junit example
------------------------------------------------

-> JUnit is an open source framework

-> Junit is used to perform Unit testing for java applications

-> JUnit provided annotations to perform unit testing

-> JUnit provided assertions to validate test results

-> JUnit will generate test results report

----------------------------------------------------------------------
@Test annotation is used to represent method as unit test method

--------------------------------------------------------------------

-> In realtime for every business class one unit test class also will be created

	DateUtils.java ---------------> DateUtilsTest.java

	UserService.java --------------> UserServiceTest.java

	UserDao.java ------------------> UserDaoTest.java


-> To Execute all Unit test methods available in project we can use maven test goal.

    Right click on project --> Run As --> Maven Test


-> If we want to skip one unit test method then we can write @Ignore annotation at method level

-> If we write @Ignore at class level, then complete class will be skipped

============
Mocking
============
Mocking is the process of creating substitute object for the real object
			or
Mocking is the process of creating alternate object for the real object

-> Mock objects are used to perform Unit Testing

-> Using Mock objects we can test our component in isolated manner

-> To create Mock objects we will use Mock frameworks

-> There are 2 types of Mock frameworks are available

	1) Proxy Based Mocking (Easy Mock)
	2) Bytecode manipulation based mocking (Power Mock)
