What is Software Testing?
------------------------
It is the process of verifying and validating application functionality with client requirements

-> Software Testing will happen in multiple stages. They are

	1) Unit Testing
	2) System Integration Testing (SIT)
	3) User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
	4) Pilot Testing
	5) Performance Testing
	

Unit Testing
------------
Testing unit amount of work is called as Unit Testing

Unit Testing will done by developers

Developers will use JUnit to perform unit testing

Unit Testing will help us in improving code quality

Using this unit testing we can provide bug free code for SIT

Once our Unit Testing is completed our code will be tested by Testing Team.

System Integration Testing
---------------------------
-> SIT will be performed by Testing team

-> If any functionality is not working in SIT, testers will raise defects or bugs using JIRA

-> Developers has to fix the bugs identified in SIT.

-> If all the functionalities are working as per client requirements then Test Manager will certify our project.

-> Once project is SIT ceritifed it will go to UAT

User Acceptance Testing
-----------------------
-> UAT will be performed by Client Side Testing Team.

-> If any bug identified in UAT, they will report in JIRA

-> Developers has to fix bugs identified in UAT

-> If all the functionalities are working in UAT then client will accept for production release.

-> If we get so many defects in UAT, then client will say No Go (Prod Deployment will be stopped).


Note: For majority of the project, UAT will happen in different company

	Development(Deloitte) ----------- UAT (KPMG)


Performance Testing
-------------------
It is the process of testing application response time


Pilot Testing
-------------
Here Application will be tested with live data


*** After Pilot Testing is completed, project will go to Production***

-> After application deployed to production, some issues may occur.

-> To fix production issues , M & O team will be available

-> M & O means Maintence & Opertions



What is Junit
-------------
-> JUnit is an open source framework

-> JUnit is used to implement Unit Testing For Java Projects
